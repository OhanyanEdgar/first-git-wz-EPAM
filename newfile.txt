This file is going to be added to my repo.

1. Create file within git dir.

2. Git will detect this file in his workin dir, but it won't be added to my local repo.
   It will be listed in "Untarcked files" section as yet.

3. Than I need to place this file to "staging area", to be able then to commit file to
   my local repo.
   - To add file to "staging area": git add <filename>.
